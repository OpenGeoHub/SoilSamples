Datasets listed here, assuming compatible open license, are afterwards imported into the Global compilation of soil chemical and physical properties and soil classes and eventually used to create better open soil information across countries. The specific objectives of this initiative are: To enable data digitization, import and binding + harmonization, To accelerate research collaboration and networking, To enable development of more accurate / more usable global and regional soil property and class maps (typically published via https://OpenLandMap.org), The minimum requirements to submit a dataset for inclusion to the OpenLandMap repository are: License and terms of used specified AND, Complete and consistent metadata that ensures correct standardization and harmonization steps AND, At least 50 unique spatial locations AND, No broken our invalid URLs, Datasets that do not satisfy the above listed requirements might be removed. If you discover an issue with license, data description or version number, please open a Github issue. Recommended settings for all datasets are: Peer-reviewed versions of the datasets (i.e. a dataset accompanied with a publication) should have the priority, Register your dataset (use e.g. https://zenodo.org) and assign a DOI to each version, Provide enough metadata so that it can be imported and bind with other data without errors, Information outdated or missing? Please open an issue or best do a correction and then a pull request. Figure 1.1: Soil profiles and soil samples with chemical and physical properties global compilation.

It brings together soil scientists, spectroscopists, informaticians, data scientists and software engineers to overcome some of the current bottlenecks preventing wider and more efficient use of soil spectroscopy. A series of working groups will be formed to address topics including calibration transfer, model choice, outreach &amp; demonstration, and use of spectroscopy to inform global carbon cycle modeling.

We specifically promote publishing and sharing of Open Geographical and Geoscientific Data, using and developing Open Source Software and encouraging and empowering under-represented researchers e.g. those from ODA recipient countries and female researchers. We believe that the key measure of quality of research in all sciences (and especially in geographical information sciences) is in transparency and reproducibility of the computer code used to generate results (read more in: “Everyone has a right to know what is happening with the planet”).
