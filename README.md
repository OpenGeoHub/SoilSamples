# Public inventory of soil samples and soil profiles

Publicly managed collection of documented soil datasets (points) available for 
research and application without restrictions. These are eventually imported and 
bind to single GeoPackage file via [the OpenLandMap repository](https://gitlab.com/openlandmap/compiled-ess-point-data-sets/).
